# NEARflix
Companies love a flat monthly subscription fee model. Why? The revenue is recurring and predictable. But, why canâ€™t we pay to watch a single football match, instead of the whole football channel?

Using NEARflix, service providers give viewers an option to decide on a pay-per-use basis for digital content. This payment is via micropayments in NEAR tokens.
